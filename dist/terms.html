                We've drafted these Terms of Service (which we simply call the "Terms") so that you'll know the rules that govern our relationship with you. Although we have tried our best to strip the legalese from the Terms, there are places where these Terms may still
                read like a traditional contract. There's a good reason for that: These Terms do indeed form a legally binding contract between you and Lovdio Inc.. So please read them carefully.

            </p>
            <p class="info">
                By using the Services, you agree to the Terms. Of course, if you don't agree with them, then don't use the Services.

            <p class="info">
                Lovdio grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Service's benefits in a way

                do so.

            </p>

            <p class="subtitle">3. Rights You Grant Us</p>
            <p class="info">
                Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is
                depends on which Services you use and the Settings you have selected.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                For all Services, you grant Lovdio a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating,
                developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.
            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Because Local is inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the license you grant us for content submitted to those Services is broader. In addition to the rights you grant us in connection with other Services, you also grant us a perpetual
                license to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly perform, and publicly display content submitted to Local or any other crowd-sourced Services in any form and in any and all media or distribution
                methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it's necessary, you also grant Lovdio and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, Local content that you upload or send.

                post, send, or store through the Service.

            </p>
            <p class="info">

            </p>

            <p class="info secondinfo">
                We always love to hear from our users. But if you volunteer feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use your ideas without compensating you.

            </p>
            <p class="subtitle">4. The Content of Others</p>
            <p class="info">
                Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that submitted it. Although
                Lovdio reserves the right to review all content that appears on the Services and to remove any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others
                provide through the Services.

            </p>
            <p class="info">

                We do not endorse, support, represent or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any content contributed by users or endorse any of the opinions expressed therein. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights
                or remedies you have or may have against us with respect thereto. You acknowledge that any reliance on User Contributed Content of any Lovdio user will be at your own risk.

            </p>

                We may offer various friends making Services that you can purchase and use through the Services. You don't own these Services; instead you buy enough app gems to use them. You'll always be shown the price for Services before you complete a purchase. But
                Lovdio does not handle payments or payment processing for any purchases; those are handled by third-party payment providers or service providers (such as, Apple's iOS Store and Google's Google Play Store, among others). Some third-party
                service providers may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. Please check the third-party service provider's relevant terms for details.

            <p class="info">
                Subject to any applicable additional terms and conditions, all purchases are final and non-refundable. And because our performance begins once you tap buy and we give you immediate access to your purchase, you waive any right you may have under EU or
                other local law to cancel your purchase once it's completed or to get a refund. BY ACCEPTING THESE TERMS, YOU AGREE THAT Lovdio IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON.

                Some of the Virtual Products we offer are for one-time use only, while others are for repeated use. But please note that "repeated" does not mean "forever." We may change, modify, or eliminate Virtual Products at any time, with or without notice. You
                agree that we will bear no liability to you or any third party if we do so. If we suspend or terminate your account, you will lose any Products you purchased through the Services.

            <p class="info">If your Lovdio account remains inactive for 3 consecutive months, all of your free virtual Coins may be frozen. To unfreeze any such virtual Coins, you must email us and request that we unfreeze your free virtual Coins. Upon receipt of your

                It's your sole responsibility to manage your purchases. If you are under 18 (or younger than the age of legal majority in your place of residence), you must obtain your parent's or guardian's consent before making any purchases.

                Lovdio does not transmit any funds and is not a money-services business. To the extent such functionality is made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other third-party service, subject to that third party's
                separate Terms of Service.

            <p class="info">
                Lovdio offers in-app purchases ("IAP") through iTunes, Google Play or other application platforms authorized by Lovdio. If you choose to make an IAP, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your application platform, and your application
                platform account (e.g. iTunes Account) will be charged for the IAP in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for IAP that apply to your application platform account. Some application
                platforms may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription IAP, your application platform account will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel the IAP. After
                your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do
                not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you can do so within the Lovdio app or log in to your application platform account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription,
                even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Lovdio application from your device. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term,
                and your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires. Deleting your account on Lovdio or deleting the Lovdio application from your device does not cancel your subscription; Lovdio will retain all funds charged to your
                application platform until you cancel your subscription.

            </p>
            <p class="info">
                Generally, all charges for IAP are nonrefundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. We may make an exception if a refund for a subscription offering is requested within fourteen days of the transaction date, or if the laws
                applicable in your jurisdiction provide for refunds. For subscribers residing in the EU or European Economic Area, in accordance with local law, you are entitled to a full refund during the 14 days after the subscription begins. Please
                note that this 14-day period commences when the subscription starts.

            </p>

            <p class="info">
                To request a refund: If you subscribed using your Apple ID, refunds are handled by Apple, not Lovdio. To request a refund, go to iTunes, click on your Apple ID, select “Purchase history,” find the transaction and hit "Report Problem". You can also submit
                a request at https://getsupport.apple.com.

                In order to reward Users for certain activities, Lovdio may give you the opportunity to earn, and use credits in Voya’s in-app virtual currency (“Coins”) that may be used to acquire virtual goods and services solely with the Services. Coins are not real
                money, do not have monetary value, and may never be redeemed for “real world” money, or other items of monetary value from outside the Services without our written permission. While we may use terms like “earn”, “trade-in”, or “cash-out”
                in reference to the Coins, we do so only for convenience and such terms in no way indicate that Coins have monetary value or are real money. You acknowledge that Coins are not real currency and are not redeemable for any sum of money from
                us at any time. We make no guarantee as to the nature, quality, or value of the features of the Services or any third-party good or services that will be accessible through the use of Coins, or the availability or supply of Coins. Coins
                obtained via the Services are provided to you under a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use within the Services.

                Coins may not be transferred to other accounts or resold in any manner, including, without limitation, by means of any direct sale or auction service. You have no property interest, right or title in or to any Coins appearing or originating in the Services
                or any other attributes associated with use of the Services. Any “virtual currency” balance shown in your account does not constitute a real-world balance or reflect any stored value, but instead constitutes a measurement of the extent
                of your license. All Coins are forfeited if your account or access to the Services is terminated or suspended for any reason, in our sole and absolute discretion, or if we discontinue availability of some or all of the Services. We may
                at any time expire free or promotional Coins given to you. We have no liability for hacking or loss of your Coins or any goods or services obtained using Coins. We have no obligation to, and will not, reimburse you for any Coins that are
                lost due to your violation of these Terms. We reserve the right, without prior notification, to limit the quantity of Coins and to refuse to provide you with any Coins. Price, exchangeability and availability of Coins are determined by
                us in our sole discretion and are subject to change without notice. You agree that we have the absolute right to manage, distribute, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate Coins as we see fit in our sole discretion, and that we will have
                no liability for exercising such right. You agree that under no circumstances are we liable to you for any damages or claims that may arise from the loss or use of your Coins regardless of the circumstances.

                You absolve us of any responsibility to maintain or update your account Coins balance. However, if there is a loss of Coins in your account due to technical or operational problems with the Services, we will refund the lost Coins once the loss has been
                verified. Without limiting any of the foregoing, our maximum liability or responsibility to you is to refund the Coins lost. You may from time to time be presented with opportunities to redeem Coins. We will, in our sole discretion, determine
                and communicate the availability and exchange rate for any Coins, which may be modified at any time. We reserve the right to cancel, restrict or terminate Coins at any time for any reason. All redemptions are subject to these Terms and
